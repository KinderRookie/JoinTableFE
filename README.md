# JoinTable

JoinTable is a mini side project designed to streamline the process of creating events, gathering participants' schedules, and organizing them based on availability. Whether you're organizing work shifts, team meetings, or events, JoinTable helps allocate time slots efficiently.

## Features

## Getting Started

Actually, this repo is just for my fun. I will not provide to clone the project but will host on AWS... someday.
